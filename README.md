This repository contains Terraform code to automate the deployment and management of a GitLab server.

Introduction
By using Terraform to manage your GitLab server, you can:

Track changes over time
Easily rollback configurations
Automate deployments
Prerequisites
Terraform installation: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/getting-started/install
GitLab account: https://gitlab.com/
Cloud provider account: If deploying to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), a corresponding account.
Usage

Plan the changes:

terraform plan

Review the planned changes.
Apply the changes:

terraform apply

For Gitlab initial root password
docker exec -it gitlab cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
